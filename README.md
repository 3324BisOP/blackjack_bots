# Blackjack Bot

This code

# Instructions

There are two bots you can look at to see how a bot should be formatted:

* `bot_bad.py` - This is a terrible bot that just randomly chooses what to do.
* `bot_human.py` - This bot lets you play as a human. It will ask you what you want to do.

To play a game, run the program using this command line syntax:

```bash
python3 game_solo.py bot_human.py 1
```

This runs a game with `bot_human` playing `1` shuffle through the deck.
